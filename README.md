The "Student Information Management System" is prepared or operates
to maintain the records of student in school as well as in college. Student
Information Management System deals with the all the activities done by
computers such as registration admission process online , and staff and class
management etc all these process are handled by the computer management
system. The student record can be maintained online for the distance accessible
to the entire student and their parents. Without the student management system
managing and maintaining the details student is tedious job for any
organization. Student information system will store all the detailed of the
students including their background information, educational qualifications,
Personal details and all the information related to their resume.
Suppose we have 1000 of student from this we have to search a particular
student we know the name of the student. In a manual system it is a tedious task
through we know the name of student but using the module we can easily search
the student by specifying the name of student in the search criteria. Thus
module will help the administrator in searching the student with the various
criteria. This student management system also contained the registration module
and account management. This module will help the student get registered from
anywhere if the internet is present. This module really simplifies the works on
paper registration. Also after successful registration the user can update
information and changed their password as when required
This student management system also contained the user module. This
module will help administrator enabling and disable a user account and change
their password when they required.
